This repo is for collecting work on tutorials and other learning
activities that would benefit from using source control.

## About License
Some of this material may be from tutorials and other sources. For these
items, which may or may not be explicitly labeled, their relevant
license applies. I will make an effort to include the information
whenever possible.
